<div class='contentWithMargin'>
	<div class='func'>
		<span class='funcName'>.zTabs('parentTab')</span>
		<p>Returns a jQuery object representing the first tab in the DOM whose content contains a match for the initial selector.</p>

		<p>The initial selector can be anything which can appear in the content area, however .zTabs('parentTab') will only match elements which currently exist in the DOM.</p>

		<p>This function is similar to .zTabs('current'), in that you can use it to target a tab without knowing any of its identifying details. This behavior is valuable if tabs have been generated dynamically, and when a content element is a more meaningful identifier than whatever tab contains it.</p>

		<div class='subSection'>Example:</div>
		<pre><code><span class='comment'>// Shows the tab containing the form with id 'formToReplace'</span>
$('form#formToReplace').zTabs('parentTab').zTabs('show');
		</code></pre>
	</div>
</div>
